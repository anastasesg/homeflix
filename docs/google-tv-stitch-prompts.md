## Prompt 1: Home / Browse Screen

Design a Google TV-inspired home screen for "Homeflix Media Hub" featuring a cinematic 16:9 layout with a near-black (#0a0a0a) background, dominated by a large hero section at the top displaying a dramatic movie backdrop (The Dark Knight) with a subtle gradient overlay that bleeds amber (#f59e0b) atmospheric glow into the surrounding UI. The hero area includes a large movie poster on the left (2:3 ratio, rounded 12px corners), title in Geist font (48px bold white), metadata row showing "2008 • Action, Crime, Drama • 152 min • 9.0★ TMDB" in light gray, a green "Downloaded" status badge with checkmark, and prominent "Play" and "Details" buttons with the Play button in vibrant amber with subtle glow. On the far left, a frosted glass sidebar (280px wide, rgba(20,20,20,0.7) with 20px blur, subtle white border-glow) displays the "Homeflix" logo in amber at top with "Media Hub" tagline beneath, followed by vertically stacked navigation items (Browse with amber left border indicating active state, Discover, Media, Library, Activity, System) using Geist font with subtle hover states. Below the hero, four horizontal carousels labeled "Continue Watching," "Trending Now," "Recently Added," and "Upcoming Releases" showcase movie/TV show cards (2:3 posters, 220px width, 16px rounded corners) with glassmorphic overlays on hover revealing title, rating, and status—some cards display green "Downloaded" badges, others yellow progress rings at "45% Downloading," orange "Wanted" stars, or red "Missing" indicators, while select posters show "4K" and "HDR" quality badges in top-right corners with semi-transparent dark backgrounds. Each carousel card features a prominent amber focus ring (3px, glowing) for D-pad navigation, smooth gradient masks fade carousel edges, and the entire interface exhibits modern glassmorphism with layered depth, 60fps smooth scrolling hints, and ambient lighting effects that make the amber brand color pulse subtly through status indicators, buttons, and interactive elements against the immersive dark environment.

## Prompt 2: Movie Detail Screen

Design a cinematic Movie Detail screen for "Homeflix" Google TV web app featuring a full-width backdrop image of a dramatic movie scene that bleeds edge-to-edge with a subtle gaussian blur gradient fading from sharp focus in the center to heavily blurred at all edges, overlaid with a dark gradient vignette (rgba(10,10,12,0.85)) that intensifies from top to bottom creating depth, while a translucent glassmorphic content panel (backdrop-filter blur 24px, rgba(20,20,22,0.75)) floats in the lower two-thirds with rounded-3xl corners (24px radius) and a subtle amber glow shadow, containing a breadcrumb trail at the very top in Geist font 14px weight-400 gray-400 reading "Browse > Movies > Inception" with chevron separators, followed by a massive movie title "INCEPTION" in Geist 56px weight-700 white with subtle text-shadow for legibility, adjacent metadata line showing "2010 • 2h 28m • PG-13" in 18px gray-300, a prominent 4.8 star rating with a filled amber (#f59e0b) star icon at 24px and rating number in bold 22px amber, below which sit genre pills "Sci-Fi" "Thriller" "Action" as rounded-full badges with amber/10 background and amber border in 14px, three large action buttons in a horizontal row with "Play" as a prominent amber-500 filled button 56px height with white text and play icon, "Add to Library" and "Watch Trailer" as glass-outline buttons (1px amber-500/40 border, backdrop-blur-sm, white text) all with 16px rounded corners, a download status bar showing green-500 "Downloaded" badge with subtle glow, quality badges "4K UHD" "HDR10" "Dolby Atmos" in small pills with green-400/20 backgrounds, file size "47.2 GB" and a completed progress bar with amber fill, a synopsis paragraph in 16px Geist weight-400 gray-300 with 1.6 line-height describing the plot, a "Cast" section header in 20px weight-600 followed by horizontal scrolling row of 8 circular actor avatars (96px diameter) with names below in 14px gray-400 and subtle amber ring on hover, and at the bottom a "More Like This" section showing 6 movie poster cards (2:3 aspect ratio, 180px wide) in a horizontal scroll with 12px gap, soft drop-shadows, and subtle scale-on-hover, all positioned with overscan-safe 64px margins on TV displays, employing Material You design tokens with elevated surfaces, adaptive color amber theming, and a subtle parallax effect where the backdrop shifts 8px on scroll creating theatrical depth.

## Prompt 3: System Dashboard / Command Center

Design a futuristic command center dashboard for "Homeflix" media hub in dark mode with a deep charcoal black background (#0a0a0a) featuring an asymmetric bento grid layout inspired by Apple's marketing grids, with a collapsed floating sidebar on the left showing only amber-colored (#f59e0b) icon glyphs for navigation against a slightly lighter black (#1a1a1a) glass panel. At the top left, display four large glassmorphic stat cards arranged in a 2x2 cluster with frosted glass effect (backdrop-blur, subtle white borders at 10% opacity, soft shadow depth), each showing a key metric: "Total Movies" with a film reel icon and "2,847" in large Geist font weight 600, "Total Shows" with a TV icon and "1,432", "Storage Used" with a database icon showing "18.7 TB / 24 TB" with a small amber progress indicator, and "Active Downloads" with a download icon showing "3" in amber color—each card containing a smooth amber-to-orange gradient sparkline mini-chart at the bottom showing trend data. To the right, a wider glass card titled "Active Downloads" in Geist font displays three movie download items stacked vertically: each item shows a crisp movie poster thumbnail (150px wide) on the left, title in white text, a smooth animated progress bar beneath filled with amber gradient (#f59e0b to #ea580c) showing percentages (67%, 82%, 34%), download speed in green text ("45.2 MB/s"), ETA in gray, and quality badges ("4K HDR", "1080p") as small rounded amber pills. Below this, a row of four service health monitor cards arranged horizontally: "Radarr" with pulsing green status dot and "Online" text, "Sonarr" with green dot and "Online", "Prowlarr" with yellow warning dot and "Degraded" status, "Jellyfin" with green dot and "Online"—all cards using the same glassmorphic treatment with icons. On the right side, a tall glass card labeled "Activity Feed" shows a vertical timeline of 8 recent events with amber circular timeline dots connected by subtle lines, each event displaying an icon, description ("Movie Downloaded: Dune Part Two", "Show Episode Grabbed: Breaking Bad S05E14", "Request Approved: The Matrix"), timestamp ("2 minutes ago", "15 minutes ago"), all in Geist font with white primary text and gray secondary text. Below the active downloads section, a "Recently Added" horizontal carousel with 7 small poster cards (120px wide) showing movie/show posters with subtle hover glow effect and rounded corners (16px radius), arranged in a smooth scrollable row with amber scroll indicators. In the bottom right, two medium-sized glass cards side by side: "Upcoming Releases" showing a calendar-style vertical list of 5 items with small poster thumbnails (60px), release dates in amber, and titles in white; and "Library Stats" featuring a smooth donut chart with Recharts-style gradients showing content breakdown (Movies 45% in amber, Shows 35% in orange, Music 12% in red, Books 8% in coral) with a legend using Geist font. The entire composition uses Google Material You design language with generous rounded corners (12-20px), elevated depth with multiple shadow layers, TV-optimized spacing (minimum 24px gutters), large readable typography (headings 24-32px, body 16-18px), and amber accent color throughout for interactive elements, progress indicators, and highlights against the deep black background with subtle noise texture overlay for depth.
