# Review Accessibility

Audit a component or page for accessibility issues — ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and screen reader support.

## Instructions

Use the `accessibility-reviewer` agent to review the following path: `$ARGUMENTS`

If no path is provided, ask the user which component or page they want reviewed.

Pass the full file or directory path to the agent and return its findings.
